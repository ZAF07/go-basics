/* Pipelines
Pipelines are simply a technique in concurrent programming which allows us to break down a large problem into smaller problems and solve them concurrently
If done properly, this could help improve the performance of our applications

Let's create a challenge to test your knowledge of pipelines in Go. The challenge is to implement a simple data processing pipeline that reads a list of integers, filters out the even numbers, squares the remaining odd numbers, and then sums them up.

	filterEvenInts(data, fChan)

// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reads from the channel that filterEvenInts sends to.
// Because the channel is unbuffered (can only store at most one value), it blocks the goroutine from execution until it has finished processing the value
// üí°Again, because we are using a unbuffered channel, this goroutine is blocked until the receiver of this channel being used (the main routine) has finished processing the value, emptying the channel once again üí°
// We have to close the channel at the end of the operation to signal that there are no more writes to that channel, so that in the main routine, it know when to stop the for loop
